# Summary
Today's CTF exercise is a simple 'search activity', kind of grateful for this since my atempts of other ctf exercises were too *difficult* for me right now ðŸ˜¢.

# Challenge
The challenge is basically converting **0x70** (hexadecimal) to its ASCII format (character).

# Solution
With the power of *Internet Search Engine* (haha), I referred to this table[^1] to find my flag.

I'll input the reference at the end of this write-up.

# Final Thoughts

This activity is quite relative to what I've learned in my THM course today - the power of `Search Skills`. It's nice to know that I get to apply the knowledge I gained earlier. Sana always, lol.

Well done, self.
